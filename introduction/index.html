    <article class="post-content"><p>The Second Year Practicals are designed to extend the experimental skills you have acquired in your first year of study.
The course combines computational elements with lab exercises, aimed at developing your abilities to analyze experimental data and develop simple theoretical models of physical systems and phenomena.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Specifically, in the Second Year Practicals, we hope to improve your ability to:</p>

<ul>
<li>solve problems in a hands-on context,</li>
<li>plan an experiment and design a procedure,</li>
<li>perform data analysis with appropriate error analysis,</li>
<li>write your own data analysis, fitting, and plotting program using Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>The course starts with an introductory lab <em>in the first session</em>, where you will work with a partner to complete a set of measurements and use the information you have to calculate the acceleartion due to gravity on Earth. This first lab does not require any Python knowledge and is designed to give you an idea of the work required for the longer experiments.</p>

<p>The introductory exercise is followed by an <em>Error Analysis Quiz</em> during the second week. The quiz will take 45 minutes and cover basic error propagation formulas. You should review the Error Analysis components from your First Year Practicals.</p>

<p>In the second and third week you will learn to use the Python programming language for data analysis. We will cover the basics of Python in about 8 hours, and provide you with on&ndash;line resources to learn more on your own. The Python component will include in-class supervised exercises, and two <em>marked problem sets</em>.</p>

<p>Following the Python tutorials you will complete 5 <em>computational lab</em> exercises. In these 5 exercises you work with a partner to make observations of a relatively simple physical system, and use Python to analyze the data, fitting simple models to the data and measuring properties of the system being studied.</p>

<p>This will be followed by 2 exercises on <em>instruments and wiring methods</em>. In one exercise you will use an <em>oscilloscope</em> to study waves from a signal generator, examine the response of the oscilloscope to different circuits, and learn the function of most of the oscilloscope features. In the second exercise you will measure the <em>output resistance of a power supply</em> using multimeters, and you will get to design your own experiment to produce the best results given the available equipment.</p>

<p>In the last 5 weeks of classes, you will do a series of <em>independent lab projects</em>. Each project will be completed with a partner and will involve making observations of a range of physical systems, using Python to model the system and perform data analysis on the data you collect.</p>

<p>The relative sophistication of our experiments compared to the first year labs and practicals means that our experiments are even more &lsquo;open ended&rsquo;. Experiment lengths are indicated by their weights rating which is a typical duration value (1 weight ~ 3 lab hours). Experiment difficulty is not related to the number of weights.</p>

<h2 id="how-things-work">How things work</h2>

<p>In the Second Year Practicals you will have your own demonstrator to whom you will continue to report throughout the term.</p>

<p>You will be assigned to a lab group under the supervision of that demonstrator, who will be your group leader and who will monitor your progress throughout the term. You will submit all of the Python and Instruments experiments to your demonstrator. For the <em>independent lab projects</em> the demonstrator will be responsible for a subset of the available experiments. You do <strong>not</strong> need to choose your demonstrators experiments for this part of the course.</p>

<p>Thus, the demonstrator serves two purposes.</p>

<h3 id="your-group-leader">Your group leader</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keeps track of your general progress throughout the term,</li>
<li>Coordinates your progress through learning Python and provides help</li>
<li>Provides the overall assessment of your laboratory work,</li>
<li>Supervises and evaluates the exercises you do,</li>
<li>Books the experiments you wish to do,</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-experiment-demonstrator-responsible-for-specific-experiments">The experiment demonstrator (responsible for specific experiments)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Supervises and evaluates your performance on the experiment,</li>
<li>Briefs you on the ideas, concepts and details of the experiment,</li>
<li>Marks the experiment lab book and analysis you submit.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>About the lab time:</em> The laboratory is designed so that its requirements can be largely completed during scheduled hours. The normal lab hours for PHY224S are: M 3-6, F 9-12.</p>

<p>The attendance during your scheduled laboratory is important and required. You <strong>may not</strong> work in the lab &ldquo;off hours&rdquo; to do extra work. Make-up sessions for early labs are possible during the overflow sessions built into the calendar. The lab rooms could be open for short periods during the week, but you will need permission form the lab coordinator to do use any equipment. It is allowed only if: you missed a lab session and have a medical note or your setup was not working properly. You cannot miss labs and expect to make up the lab at your convenience.</p>

<p>You should bring a lab book to the class (available from the bookstore or the Physics store). The lab book does not need to be branded or include carbon copy pages. It should be a bound book and not loose leaf pages. You will write the experiment descriptions, observations and interpretations in your lab notebook while in the lab. You will also perform data analysis and write the discussion in the lab book. Printed figures and Python code can be attached to the lab book as needed.</p>

<p>When doing the independent experiments check that you have an experiment booked for the next class. Check with a demonstrator or coordinator if you wish to change a booked lab or ask questions about an experiment. A calendar of experiment bookings is maintained by the coordinator, and there are a limited number of stations available for each experiment.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> an experiment is considered complete, only when the write-up is complete and the report is ready to be graded. You will not be allowed to work on a new experiment if you have un-submitted late experiments (after 7 days).</p></article>
