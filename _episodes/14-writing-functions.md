## Break programs down into functions to make them easier to understand.

*   Human beings can only keep a few items in working memory at a time.
*   Understand larger/more complicated ideas by understanding and combining pieces.
    *   Components in a machine.
    *   Lemmas when proving theorems.
*   Functions serve the same purpose in programs.
    *   *Encapsulate* complexity so that we can treat it as a single "thing".
*   Also enables *re-use*.
    *   Write one time, use many times.

## Define a function using `def` with a name, parameters, and a block of code.

*   Begin the definition of a new function with `def`.
*   Followed by the name of the function.
    *   Must obey the same rules as variable names.
*   Then *parameters* in parentheses.
    *   Empty parentheses if the function doesn't take any inputs.
    *   We will discuss this in detail in a moment.
*   Then a colon.
*   Then an indented block of code.

~~~
def print_greeting():
    print('Hello!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Defining a function does not run it.

*   Defining a function does not run it.
    *   Like assigning a value to a variable.
*   Must call the function to execute the code it contains.

~~~
print_greeting()
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
Hello!
~~~
{: .output}

## Arguments in call are matched to parameters in definition.

*   Functions are most useful when they can operate on different data.
*   Specify *parameters* when defining a function.
    *   These become variables when the function is executed.
    *   Are assigned the arguments in the call (i.e., the values passed to the function).
    *   If you don't name the arguments when using them in the call, the arguments will be matched to
parameters in the order the parameters are defined in the function.

~~~
def print_date(year, month, day):
    joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
    print(joined)

print_date(1871, 3, 19)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
1871/3/19
~~~
{: .output}

Or, we can name the arguments when we call the function, which allows us to
specify them in any order:
~~~
print_date(month=3, day=19, year=1871)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
1871/3/19
~~~
{: .output}

## Functions may return a result to their caller using `return`.

*   Use `return ...` to give a value back to the caller.
*   May occur anywhere in the function.
*   But functions are easier to understand if `return` occurs:
    *   At the start to handle special cases.
    *   At the very end, with a final result.

~~~
def average(values):
    if len(values) == 0:
        return None
    return sum(values) / len(values)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
a = average([1, 3, 4])
print('average of actual values:', a)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
2.6666666666666665
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('average of empty list:', average([]))
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
None
~~~
{: .output}

*   Remember: [every function returns something]({{ page.root }}/04-built-in/).
*   A function that doesn't explicitly `return` a value automatically returns `None`.

~~~
result = print_date(1871, 3, 19)
print('result of call is:', result)

result of call is: None

> ## Identifying Syntax Errors
>
> 1. Read the code below and try to identify what the errors are
>    *without* running it.
> 2. Run the code and read the error message.
>    Is it a `SyntaxError` or an `IndentationError`?
> 3. Fix the error.
> 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have fixed all the errors.

> > A function call always needs parenthesis, otherwise you get memory address of the function object. So, if we wanted to call the function named report, and give it the value 22.5 to report on, we could have our function call as follows

> ## Order of Operations

> The example above:

> result = print_date(1871, 3, 19)

> {: .language-python}

> printed:
> ~~~
> 1871/3/19
> result of call is: None
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> Explain why the two lines of output appeared in the order they did.
>
> What's wrong in this example?
> ~~~
> result = print_date(1871,3,19)
>
> def print_date(year, month, day):
>    joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
>    print(joined)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > 1. The first line of output (`1871/3/19`) is from the print function inside `print_date()`, while the second line
> > is from the print function below the function call. All of the code inside `print_date()` is executed first, and
> > the program then "leaves" the function and executes the rest of the code.   
> > 2. The problem with the example is that the function is defined *after* the call to the function is made. Python
> > therefore doesn't understand the function call.

> ## Calling by Name

> def print_date(year, month, day):
>     joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
>     print(joined)

> We saw that we can call the function using *named arguments*, like this:
> ~~~
> print_date(day=1, month=2, year=2003)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> 1.  What does `print_date(day=1, month=2, year=2003)` print?
> 2.  When have you seen a function call like this before?
> 3.  When and why is it useful to call functions this way?
> {: .language-python}
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > 1. `2003/2/1`
> > 2. We saw examples of using *named arguments* when working with the pandas library. For example, when reading in a dataset 
> > using `data = pandas.read_csv('data/gapminder_gdp_europe.csv', index_col='country')`, the last argument `index_col` is a 
> > named argument.  
> > 3. Using named arguments can make code more readable since one can see from the function call what name the different arguments 
> > have inside the function. It can also reduce the chances of passing arguments in the wrong order, since by using named arguments 
> > the order doesn't matter.

> 1. Create a function definition for `print_egg_label()` that will work with the revised program above.  Note, the function's return value will be significant. Sample output might be `71.23 large`.
> 2.  A dirty egg might have a mass of more than 90 grams, and a spoiled or broken egg will probably have a mass that's less than 50 grams.  Modify your `print_egg_label()` function to account for these error conditions. Sample output could be `25 too light, probably spoiled`.
